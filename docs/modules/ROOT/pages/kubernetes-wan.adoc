:description: Synchronize data in two Hazelcast clusters that are hosted in different Kubernetes environments, using WAN Replication.

{description}

== Before you Begin

This tutorial focuses on the WAN Replication feature and assumes that you have some general knowledge about Hazelcast in Kubernetes. Here are some resources:

* https://hazelcast.com/product-features/wan-replication/[Hazelcast WAN Replication]
* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes README]
* xref:kubernetes.adoc[]
* xref:kubernetes-embedded.adoc[]

The tutorial also assumes that you have two running Kubernetes clusters, and the `kubectl` tool installed. For all the commands the term _receiver_ means that `kubectl` uses the context of the receiver cluster, and the term _publisher_ means that `kubectl` uses the context of the publisher cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The code samples present WAN Replication via LoadBalancer, which may result in the communication over only one of the target members. If you need higher performance, see xref:kubernetes-external-client.adoc[External Smart Client] and use such a configuration in the WAN Replication part.
====

== 1. Create Receiver Cluster

Hazelcast uses Kubernetes API for the member discovery and it therefore requires granting view permission to certain resources.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
----

Then, create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal license=<hz-license-key>
----

Now, you can create the cluster with the following command.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl apply -f receiver/statefulset.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
If you use Minikube, you need to execute minikube tunnel now in order to get LoadBalancer External IPs assigned.
====

Check that the cluster works correctly and note its External Load Balancer IP.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl get all
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/hazelcast-0   1/1     Running   0          2m21s
pod/hazelcast-1   1/1     Running   0          2m11s
pod/hazelcast-2   1/1     Running   0          2m1s

NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
service/hazelcast    LoadBalancer   10.171.245.205   35.240.109.13   5701:31092/TCP   2m22s
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.171.240.1     <none>          443/TCP          38m

NAME                         READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/hazelcast   3/3     2m22s
----

The external IP of the Hazelcast cluster is: *35.240.109.13*.

== 2. Create Publisher Cluster

Again, we need to grant Kubernetes API resource permissions.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
----

Then, update the WAN Replication configuration in publisher/hazelcast.yaml with the external IP of the Receiver cluster.

[source, yaml]
----
wan-replication:
  my-wan-replication:
    batch-publisher:
      my-publisher:
        cluster-name: dev
        target-endpoints: 35.240.109.13
----

Create ConfigMap with the Hazelcast configuration.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=publisher/hazelcast.yaml
----

Again, we need to create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise license key.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal license=<hz-license-key>
----

Finally, we can start the publisher Hazelcast cluster.

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl apply -f publisher/statefulset.yaml
----

Your two Hazelcast clusters are set up with the WAN Replication. Now, we can check if everything works correctly.

== 3. Verify WAN Replication

Insert data into the publisher Hazelcast cluster

[source, shell]
----
(Publisher) $ kubectl exec -it hazelcast-0 -- /bin/bash
# java -cp lib/hazelcast-enterprise-all*.jar com.hazelcast.client.console.ClientConsoleApp
hazelcast[default] > ns rep
namespace: rep
hazelcast[rep] > m.put key value
null
----

Check that the data was replicated to the receiver Hazelcast cluster.

[source, shell]
----
(Receiver) $ kubectl exec -it hazelcast-0 -- /bin/bash
# java -cp lib/hazelcast-enterprise-all*.jar com.hazelcast.client.console.ClientConsoleApp
hazelcast[default] > ns rep
hazelcast[rep] > m.get key
value
----

== Summary

In this tutorial, you have seen how to use Hazelcast WAN replication features that can be used to keep multiple Hazelcast clusters in sync. WAN replication can be very useful for https://hazelcast.com/resources/multi-cloud-deployments-run-hazelcast-anywhere-and-everywhere/[Multi-Cloud Deployments].
